 # ES2015+ syntax

 ## Let and Const

 ### Overview

 When declaring a variable with the keyword `var`, the variable’s declaration gets hoisted. What does that mean?

Let’s say we declared a function like this:

```javascript
function getClothing(isCold) {
  if (isCold) {
    var freezing = 'Grab a jacket!';
  } else {
    var hot = 'It’s a shorts kind of day.';
    console.log(freezing);
  }
}
```

Before this code gets executed all variables are ‘hoisted’ which means their declarations gets raised to the top of the function scope. So at run-time the code above will look like this:

```javascript
function getClothing(isCold) {
  var freezing, hot;
  if (isCold) {
    freezing = 'Grab a jacket!';
  } else {
    hot = 'It’s a shorts kind of day.';
    console.log(freezing);
  }
}
```

So when the code gets executed it’s not going throw `ReferenceError: freezing is not defined`, instead it’s going to throw `undefined`.

Variables declared with `let` and `const` eliminate this specific issue of hoisting because they’re scoped to the block, not to the function. Previously, when we used `var`, variables were either scoped globally or locally to an entire function scope.

### Rules for using

* Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, but can’t be redeclared in the same scope
* Variables declared with `const` must be assigned an initial value, but can’t be redeclared in the same scope, and can’t be reassigned

### Use cases

* Use `let` when you plan to reassign new values to a variable
* use `const` when you don’t plan on reassigning new values to a variable

## Template Literals

Template literals are essentially string literals that include embedded expressions. English please!?

Let’s say we have this code, in ES5 syntax:
```javascript
const me = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 69 /* :) */,
  get fullName(){
    return this.firstName.concat(' ').concat(this.lastName);
  },
  get bio(){
    return 'my name is ' + this.fullName() + ' , I am ' + this.age + ' years old.';
  }
}
```

It could get way more complicated if we wanted to include newlines `\n`.

ES2015 introduced **Template Literals** (previously referred to as **template strings**.) that solve this problem. So the above code in ES2015 syntax would look like this:

```javascript
const me = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 69,
  get fullName(){
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
  get bio(){
    return `my name is ${this.fullName}, I am ${this.age} years old.`
  }
}
```

Besides making the code easier to read and overall beautiful, Template literals preserve newlines. The `${...}` are called Delimiters and they play the role of placeholders to include any **expression**.

## Destructuring

The **Destructuring assignment** syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

### For arrays

```javascript
let [a, b] = [1, 2, 3];
// => a = 1 and b = 2

const pets = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Gold fish', 'Bird'];
const [pet0, pet1, /* this one is empty */, pet3] = pets;
// => pet0 = 'Dog', pet1 = 'Cat', pet3 = 'Bird'
```

**Note**: the order is important!

### For Objects

```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 69,
  hobbies: ['Something', 'Another thing', 'Something else']
}

const {hobbies, name} = me;
// => hobbies = ['Something', ...], name = 'John Doe'
```

**Note**: order is not important, but variables need to have the same names as their counterpart properties.


## Arrow Functions

An **arrow function expression** behave the same way as "regular" (function expression and function declaration statement) but it has a shorter syntax and also doesn't have its own [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), [`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments), [`super`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super), or [`new.target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target). These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

### Concise body syntax

* has no curly braces surrounding the function body
*	and automatically returns the expression.

```javascript
const myFunc = (param1, ..., paramN) => /* an expression to return */;
const myFunc = param => /* an expression to return */;
const myFunc = () => /* an expression to return */;
```

### Block syntax

*	it uses curly braces to wrap the function body
*	and a return statement needs to be used to actually return something from the function.

```javascript
const myFunc = (param1, ..., paramN) => {
   /* ... */
   /* an expression to return or not */
};

const myFunc = param => {
   /* ... */
   /* an expression to return or not */
};

const myFunc = () => {
   /* ... */
   /* an expression to return or not */
};
```

**Note**: when passing only one parameter, it is not required to wrap it in parentheses, but when we have multiple or no parameters it is required to include the parentheses.

### Regular functions and this keyword

*	If the function is called with the `new` keyword (i.e. as a constructor), then the `this` keyword inside that function is a new object.
* If the function is called as a method of an object (e.g. `obj.someMethod();`), then the `this` keyword inside that function/method refers to that object (in this case `obj`).
*	If the function is called with no context, then `this` keyword is either `global` object or `undefined` in **strict mode**.

In a nutshell. With regular functions, the value of `this` is set based on how the function is called.

[More details about `this` keyword here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).

### Arrow functions and this keyword

With arrow functions, the value of `this` is based on the function's surrounding context. In other words, the value of `this` inside an arrow function is the same as the value of `this` outside the function.

```javascript
const obj = {
   whatIsThis1(){
      console.log(this);
   },
   whatIsThis2: () => {
      console.log(this);
   }
}

obj.whatIsThis1(); // logs the obj object
obj.whatIsThis2(); // logs the global object
```

## Default values

Default values can be used for function parameters to allow formal parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or `undefined` is passed.

```javascript
const myFunc = (param1=defVal1, ..., paramN=defValN) => {
   /* ... */
}
```
It can also be used with [**Destructuring assignments**](#destructuring) in case one of the object properties is not there.

```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 69,
  hobbies: ['Something', 'Another thing', 'Something else']
}

const {name, age, favoriteColor} = me;
// name='John Doe', age=69, favoriteColor=undefined
```

This can be avoided by setting default values

```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 69,
  hobbies: ['Something', 'Another thing', 'Something else']
}

const {name='XY XX', age=0, favoriteColor='Black', hobbies=[]} = me;
// name='John Doe', age=69, favoriteColor='Black', hobbies=['Something', ...]
```

**Note**: default values only take place if the property is not there or if its value is `undefined`.

We can also set default values and rename variables at the same time

```javascript
// location is a reserved word in the browser :(
const locaxion = {
  lat: 40.7290776,
  lng: -74.0006519,
  alt: 50
}

const {lat: latitude = 1, lng: longitude = 1, alt: altitude = 1} = locaxion
// variables identify with latitude, longitude and altitude
```

Default parameters can be used with Destructuring to create some powerful functions!


## Classes and Objects

### overview

JavaScript is not a class based language (e.g. Java), instead it uses functions to create objects and links objects together by [prototypal inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). ES2015’s `class` keyword, class methods and whatnot are just syntactical sugar.

To create a class with ES2015 syntax, all we need to do is invoke the `class` keyword,

```javascript
class Vehicle {
  constructor(type, year){
    this.type = type;
    this.year = year;
    this.engineSound = 'Vroom! Vroom!';
    this.engineStart = false;
  }
  start(){
    console.log(`Starting engine: ${this.engineSound}`);
    this.engineStart = true;
  }
  static whatAmI(){
    console.log('I am a vehicle!');
  }
}
```

The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.

The `static` keyword defines a static method for a class. Static method calls are made directly on the class and are not callable on instances of the class. Static methods are often used to create utility functions.

**Note**: `this` keyword inside static methods is always `undefined`.

### Subclasses

Subclasses in ES2015 are very simple, all we need to do is call the `extends` keyword. Let’s say we have another class `Car` that inherits from the `Vehicle` class above

```javascript
class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(type = 'Mercedice', year = '2018'){
    super(type, year);
    this.wheels = 4;
  }
}
```

Here the constructor uses the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class, in this case `Vehicle`.

**Note**: `super` must be called before `this`.

We don’t need to reset the child class’s constructor when creating the said class with the class keyword like in **ES5**, e.g.

```javascript
Car.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);
// resetting Car constructor
Car.prototype.constructor = Car;
```

**Note**: difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not.

Just like constructor functions to create an instance of a class we need to invoke it using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
class Car extends Vehicle {
  ...
}
const myCar = new Car('mercedice', '2017');
```
